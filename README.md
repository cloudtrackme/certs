This repository is the **public proof store** for all music releases on [CloudTrack.me](https://cloudtrack.me).

Each release on CloudTrack automatically generates a **Release Certificate** (in JSON and PDF format) that proves:
- The **authorship** of the creator
- The **timestamp** of upload and release
- The **file hash (SHA-256)** for integrity
- The **platform digital signature**
- The **GitHub commit record** for immutability
